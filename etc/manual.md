Awaiting revision.

since I haven't completed this 'game' i'm gonna put some fun little gimmicks in here:

How to save the game:

Uncompiled version:
If you got the uncompiled version of the game and compiled it yourself you need to go
to source folder (while the game is still running) e.g. adven-master their is already
a folder called saves there should be a file called something like "SAVE.ps1" just open
up this powershell fle and follow the instructions it gives

chaining commands:
if you want to chain commands like you can in *nix systems all you have to do is
input the commands like this "command1 command2 command2" because C is bad at strings
it will do the first command then it will override the string with the second inputed
command and third and fourth and so on; meaning if you know the game really really well
you could probably make command chain so long that it completes the game in one line.
