# Adven pre alpha version 0.0.34 Windows version (GNU/Linux coming soon!)

# Development for Adven is gonna slow down for the holidays, for now I will make a fork of this for GNU/Linux, I will work on that for the time being. The windows version will be a side project :-)
codename: 8-Ball

First usable version! sort of...

To play this "game" you are going to need the standard C/C++ headers
and a compiler, im currently testing percompiled versions of this but 
for now you are going to have compile this yourself.
And If you want to know how the versioning works, it used to be that every
commit was a new version but now it's every new release is versioned 
by the amount of commits.

Also I will not accept most pull requests but If it's really necessairy I'll see about it.
