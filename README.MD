# Adven pre alpha version 0.1.2 for GNU/Linux

# Compilable but semi-functional

What you are going to need to compile:
* GCC
* GNU/Linux

To compile this you need to find main.c which can be found in Adven/src/main,
just type in
```
gcc main.c -w && mv a.out ../../bin/adven
```

Also if you're interested in creating a Windows compatible version for some
unknown reason contact me!
