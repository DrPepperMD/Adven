This folder contains the precompiled binaries of every release,
I reccomend you use these or compile it your self and place it here
this is importent as the game is programmed to access the save folder
from here (though I guess if you compile it yourself then you could
change the properties) but if you do have the game here I think it would
be a good idea to make a short cut to this place or to the file.
